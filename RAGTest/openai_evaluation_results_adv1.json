    "expected_answer": "The Transformer is a neural network architecture based entirely on attention mechanisms, eliminating recurrence and convolution.",
    "generated_answer": "The Transformer architecture is a model that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to establish global dependencies between input and output, without using recurrence or convolution. It features an encoder-decoder structure, where both the encoder and decoder are composed of stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers. The encoder consists of a stack of six identical layers, each with a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise feed-forward network, with residual connections and layer normalization applied. The architecture allows for significant parallelization, improving computational efficiency and translation quality, as demonstrated by its state-of-the-art performance on machine translation tasks.",

    "expected_answer": "Self-attention enables parallelization and shorter path lengths for learning long-range dependencies, improving efficiency and scalability.",
    "generated_answer": "Self-attention is preferred over recurrence in Transformers because it allows for modeling global dependencies between input and output sequences without regard to their distance, reducing the number of operations to a constant. This makes self-attention computationally more efficient than recurrent layers, which require sequential operations. Additionally, self-attention enables parallelization, which is not possible with recurrent networks, leading to faster computation, especially for longer sequences.",

    "generated_answer": "Multi-head attention is a mechanism that allows a model to attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions simultaneously. It involves using multiple attention layers, or heads, in parallel. Each head independently performs attention operations with its own set of learned projection matrices, allowing the model to capture diverse aspects of the input data. The outputs from all heads are concatenated and projected to form the final output. This approach helps to counteract the averaging effect seen in single-head attention and maintains computational efficiency by reducing the dimensionality of each head.",
