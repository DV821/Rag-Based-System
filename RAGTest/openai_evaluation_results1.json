    "expected_answer": "The Transformer is a neural network architecture based entirely on attention mechanisms, eliminating recurrence and convolution.",
    "generated_answer": "The Transformer architecture is a model that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to establish global dependencies between input and output, without using recurrence or convolution. It consists of an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder is composed of a stack of six identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. Residual connections and layer normalization are applied around each sub-layer. The Transformer allows for significant parallelization, improving computational efficiency and translation quality, as demonstrated by its performance on machine translation tasks.",

    "expected_answer": "Self-attention enables parallelization and shorter path lengths for learning long-range dependencies, improving efficiency and scalability.",
    "generated_answer": "Self-attention is preferred over recurrence in Transformers because it allows for modeling dependencies between different positions in a sequence without regard to their distance, which is a limitation in recurrent networks. Self-attention reduces the number of operations needed to a constant, making it computationally more efficient than recurrent layers, which require sequential operations. This efficiency is achieved without the need for sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution, allowing the Transformer to compute representations of its input and output entirely through attention mechanisms.",

    "generated_answer": "Multi-head attention is a mechanism that allows a model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. It consists of several attention layers running in parallel, known as attention heads. Each head performs scaled dot-product attention, where queries, keys, and values are projected using parameter matrices. The outputs of these attention heads are concatenated and projected again to form the final output. Multi-head attention enables the model to capture more nuanced relationships in the data by attending to different parts of the input simultaneously, without the averaging inhibition that occurs with a single attention head. In the context provided, the Transformer model employs 8 parallel attention heads, with each head having reduced dimensionality, making the computational cost similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.",
