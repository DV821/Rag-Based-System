    "expected_answer": "The Transformer is a neural network architecture based entirely on attention mechanisms, eliminating recurrence and convolution.",
    "generated_answer": "The Transformer architecture is a model that eschews recurrence and relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. It consists of an encoder and a decoder, both of which are composed of stacked layers.\n\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N (in this case, N = 6) identical layers, each with two sub-layers:\n\n1. A multi-head self-attention mechanism\n2. A simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network\n\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N identical layers, each with two sub-layers:\n\n1. A multi-head self-attention mechanism\n2. A simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network\n\nResidual connections and layer normalization are used around each of the two sub-layers in both the encoder and decoder. The output of each sub-layer is calculated as LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself.\n\nThe Transformer architecture allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.",

    "query": "Why is self-attention preferred over recurrence in Transformers?",
    "expected_answer": "Self-attention enables parallelization and shorter path lengths for learning long-range dependencies, improving efficiency and scalability.",
    "generated_answer": "Self-attention is preferred over recurrence in Transformers because it allows modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences, as mentioned in the context. This is in contrast to recurrent networks, which are limited by their sequential nature and become computationally expensive at longer sequence lengths.\n\nAdditionally, self-attention reduces the complexity of modeling dependencies between distant positions, which is a challenge in models like ConvS2S and ByteNet. In the Transformer, this is reduced to a constant number of operations, making it more efficient.\n\nFurthermore, self-attention enables the model to draw global dependencies between input and output sequences, which is a key advantage over recurrent networks. This is achieved through the use of Multi-Head Attention, which counteracts the reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions.\n\nOverall, self-attention is preferred over recurrence in Transformers because it provides a more efficient and effective way to model dependencies between distant positions, allowing the model to capture global dependencies and achieve better performance.",

    "query": "What is multi-head attention?",
    "expected_answer": "Multi-head attention allows the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces simultaneously.",
    "generated_answer": "Multi-head attention is a mechanism that allows a model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. It is achieved by applying multiple attention heads in parallel, each with its own set of query, key, and value projections. This is in contrast to single-head attention, where averaging inhibits the ability to attend to different subspaces.\n\nThe formula for multi-head attention is given by:\n\nMultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)W O\n\nwhere headi = Attention(QW Q\ni , KW K\ni , V W V\ni )\n\nIn this formula, h is the number of parallel attention layers (or heads), and W Q\ni , W K\ni , and W V\ni are parameter matrices for each head. The output of each head is concatenated and then projected using W O to obtain the final output.\n\nIn the context of the Transformer model, multi-head attention is used in three different ways, including \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, where the queries come from the previous decoder layer. The Transformer uses 8 parallel attention layers, with each head having a reduced dimension of 64, which results in a similar computational cost to single-head attention with full dimensionality.",
