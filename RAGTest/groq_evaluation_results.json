    "generated_answer": "The Transformer architecture is a model architecture that eschews recurrence and instead relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. It follows an overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder.\n\nThe Transformer architecture consists of:\n\n- Encoder: A stack of N (6 in this case) identical layers, each with two sub-layers:\n  1. A multi-head self-attention mechanism\n  2. A simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network\n  Residual connections and layer normalization are employed around each sub-layer.\n\n- Decoder: Similar to the encoder, but the architecture is not fully described in the provided context.\n\nThe Transformer architecture allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.",

    "expected_answer": "Self-attention enables parallelization and shorter path lengths for learning long-range dependencies, improving efficiency and scalability.",
    "generated_answer": "Based on the provided context, self-attention is preferred over recurrence in Transformers because it allows modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences. This is in contrast to recurrent networks, which have a sequential nature that precludes parallelization within training examples, making it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions.\n\nAdditionally, the context mentions that self-attention has been successfully used in various tasks, including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment, and learning task-independent sentence representations. This suggests that self-attention is a powerful mechanism for modeling sequential data.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the context does not explicitly state why self-attention is preferred over recurrence in Transformers. Instead, it presents self-attention as a key component of the Transformer architecture, which eschews recurrence in favor of attention mechanisms.",

    "query": "What is multi-head attention?",
    "expected_answer": "Multi-head attention allows the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces simultaneously.",
    "generated_answer": "Multi-head attention is a mechanism that allows a model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. It is achieved by applying multiple attention heads in parallel, each with its own set of query, key, and value projections. This is in contrast to single-head attention, where averaging inhibits the ability to jointly attend to different subspaces.\n\nThe formula for multi-head attention is given by:\n\nMultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)W O\n\nwhere headi = Attention(QW Q\ni , KW K\ni , V W V\ni )\n\nIn this formula, h is the number of parallel attention layers, or heads, and W Q\ni , W K\ni , and W V\ni are parameter matrices for each head. The output of multi-head attention is a concatenation of the outputs from each head, followed by a final projection matrix W O.\n\nIn the context of the Transformer model, multi-head attention is used in three different ways, including encoder-decoder attention layers, where the queries come from the previous decoder layer. The Transformer uses 8 parallel attention layers, or heads, with each head having a reduced dimension of 64. This allows the total computational cost to be similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.",
