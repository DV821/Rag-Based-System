    "expected_answer": "The Transformer is a neural network architecture based entirely on attention mechanisms, eliminating recurrence and convolution.",
    "generated_answer": "The Transformer architecture is a model that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to establish global dependencies between input and output, without using recurrence or convolution. It consists of an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder is composed of a stack of six identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. Residual connections and layer normalization are applied around each sub-layer. The Transformer allows for significant parallelization, improving computational efficiency and translation quality. It achieves state-of-the-art results in machine translation tasks, such as the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks, with reduced training time compared to previous models.",

    "expected_answer": "Self-attention enables parallelization and shorter path lengths for learning long-range dependencies, improving efficiency and scalability.",
    "generated_answer": "Self-attention is preferred over recurrence in Transformers because it allows for modeling dependencies between different positions in a sequence without regard to their distance, which is a limitation in recurrent networks. Self-attention reduces the number of operations needed to a constant, as opposed to the linear number of operations required by recurrent layers. This makes self-attention computationally more efficient, especially for longer sequences, as it avoids the sequential nature of recurrence that precludes parallelization within training examples. Additionally, self-attention enables the Transformer to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution, which simplifies the model architecture.",

    "generated_answer": "Multi-head attention is a mechanism that allows a model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. It consists of several attention layers, or heads, running in parallel. Each head performs attention using its own set of parameter matrices, and the outputs of these heads are concatenated and projected to produce the final values. This approach helps to counteract the averaging effect that occurs with a single attention head, allowing the model to capture more nuanced dependencies in the data. In the context provided, the Transformer model employs 8 parallel attention heads, with each head operating on reduced dimensions to maintain computational efficiency.",
