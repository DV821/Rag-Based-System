It follows an encoder-decoder structure, with the encoder mapping an input sequence to a sequence of continuous representations and the decoder generating an output sequence.\n\nThe Transformer architecture consists of:\n\n1. Encoder: A stack of N (6 in this case) identical layers, each with two sub-layers:\n   - A multi-head self-attention mechanism\n   - A simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network\n   Both sub-layers use residual connections and layer normalization.\n\n2. Decoder: Similar to the encoder, with two sub-layers:\n   - A multi-head self-attention mechanism\n   - A simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network\n   Again, both sub-layers use residual connections and layer normalization.\n\nThe Transformer architecture is designed to be more parallelizable and efficient than traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing it to reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for a relatively short period of time.",

    "expected_answer": "Self-attention enables parallelization and shorter path lengths for learning long-range dependencies, improving efficiency and scalability.",
    "generated_answer": "Self-attention is preferred over recurrence in Transformers because it reduces the computational complexity of sequential operations. Unlike recurrent layers, which require O(n) sequential operations, self-attention layers can be executed in parallel, resulting in a constant number of operations. This makes self-attention faster and more computationally efficient, especially for longer sequence lengths where memory constraints limit batching across examples.",

    "generated_answer": "Multi-head attention is a mechanism that allows a model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. It is a key component of the Transformer model architecture, which eschews recurrence and relies entirely on attention mechanisms to draw global dependencies between input and output.\n\nIn multi-head attention, the input is split into multiple attention heads, each of which computes a weighted sum of the input elements. The weights are computed using a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key. The outputs from each head are then concatenated and projected using a linear transformation to produce the final output.\n\nThe Transformer model uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n\n1. Encoder-decoder attention: The queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder.\n2. Self-attention in the encoder: All of the keys, values, and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder.\n3. Self-attention in the decoder: Each position in the decoder can attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position.\n\nMulti-head attention is used to counteract the reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, which is a limitation of single-head attention. It is also used to prevent leftward attention in the decoder, which can make it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions.",
