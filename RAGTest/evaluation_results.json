    "expected_answer": "The Transformer is a neural network architecture based solely on attention mechanisms, eliminating recurrence and convolutions.",
    "generated_answer": "The Transformer architecture is a model that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to establish global dependencies between input and output, eschewing recurrence and convolutional neural networks. It allows for significant parallelization, which reduces training time. The architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder, both using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers. The encoder is composed of six identical layers, each with a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. Residual connections and layer normalization are employed around each sub-layer, with all sub-layers and embedding layers producing outputs of dimension 512. The Transformer has demonstrated superior performance in machine translation tasks, achieving high BLEU scores with less training time compared to previous models.",

    "generated_answer": "Multi-head attention is beneficial in the Transformer because it allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. This is achieved by using multiple attention heads, which prevents the averaging effect that would occur with a single attention head. By employing multiple heads, the Transformer can capture more nuanced patterns and dependencies in the data, enhancing its ability to model complex sequences. Additionally, the use of multiple heads with reduced dimensions keeps the computational cost similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.",

Self-attention layers connect all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, allowing for greater parallelization. In contrast, recurrent layers require O(n) sequential operations, making them less efficient for long sequences.
