Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself.

Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions.

Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3\\nOptimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\\n(3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4\\nRegularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Introduction\\nIn recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and\\nevolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap\\ntowards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\\nRecently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline.\\nIt has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt\\nto user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against\\npre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI’s o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models\\nwere the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-of-\\nThought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various\\nreasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge\\nof effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior\\nworks have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman\\net al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (Kumar et al., 2024),\\nand search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search (Feng et al., 2024; Trinh\\net al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024). However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning\\nperformance comparable to OpenAI’s o1 series models.\\nIn this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities\\nusing pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop\\nreasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through\\na pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ\\nGRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning.\\nDuring training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting\\nreasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance\\non reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to\\n71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance\\nof OpenAI-o1-0912.\\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language\\nmixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce\\nDeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training\\npipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the\\nDeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1-\\nZero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection\\nsampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains\\nsuch as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model.\\nAfter fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking\\ninto account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to\\nas DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217.\\nWe further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.5-\\n32B (Qwen, 2024b) as the base model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 outperforms applying\\nRL on it. This demonstrates that the reasoning patterns discovered by larger base models are cru-\\ncial for improving reasoning capabilities. We open-source the distilled Qwen and Llama (Dubey\\net al., 2024) series. Notably, our distilled 14B model outperforms state-of-the-art open-source\\nQwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a) by a large margin, and the distilled 32B and 70B models set a\\nnew record on the reasoning benchmarks among dense models.\\n3'),\n",

Contributions\\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\\n• We directly apply RL to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as\\na preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for\\nsolving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-\\nR1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating\\nlong CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the\\nfirst open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized\\npurely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future\\nadvancements in this area.\\n• We introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL\\nstages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human pref-\\nerences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model’s reasoning and\\nnon-reasoning capabilities. We believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating\\nbetter models.\\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\\n• We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller\\nmodels, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered\\nthrough RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit\\nthe research community to distill better smaller models in the future.\\n• Using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models\\nthat are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that\\nthe distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. DeepSeek-\\nR1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves 55.5% on AIME 2024, surpassing QwQ-32B-Preview. Addi-\\ntionally, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B scores 72.6% on AIME 2024, 94.3% on MATH-500,\\nand 57.2% on LiveCodeBench. These results significantly outperform previous open-\\nsource models and are comparable to o1-mini. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B,\\n32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\\n1.2. Summary of Evaluation Results\\n• Reasoning tasks: (1) DeepSeek-R1 achieves a score of 79.8% Pass@1 on AIME 2024, slightly\\nsurpassing OpenAI-o1-1217. On MATH-500, it attains an impressive score of 97.3%,\\nperforming on par with OpenAI-o1-1217 and significantly outperforming other models. (2)\\nOn coding-related tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates expert level in code competition tasks,\\nas it achieves 2,029 Elo rating on Codeforces outperforming 96.3% human participants in\\nthe competition. For engineering-related tasks, DeepSeek-R1 performs slightly better than\\nDeepSeek-V3, which could help developers in real world tasks.\\n• Knowledge: On benchmarks such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA Diamond, DeepSeek-\\nR1 achieves outstanding results, significantly outperforming DeepSeek-V3 with scores\\nof 90.8% on MMLU, 84.0% on MMLU-Pro, and 71.5% on GPQA Diamond. While its\\nperformance is slightly below that of OpenAI-o1-1217 on these benchmarks, DeepSeek-R1\\nsurpasses other closed-source models, demonstrating its competitive edge in educational\\ntasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3,\\ndemonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed\\nwhere OpenAI-o1 surpasses 4o on this benchmark.\\n4'),\n",

Approach\\n2.1. Overview\\nPrevious work has heavily relied on large amounts of supervised data to enhance model\\nperformance. In this study, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly\\nimproved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised\\nfine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start. Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with\\nthe inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data. In the following sections, we present: (1)\\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, which applies RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, and\\n(2) DeepSeek-R1, which applies RL starting from a checkpoint fine-tuned with thousands of\\nlong Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples. 3) Distill the reasoning capability from DeepSeek-R1 to\\nsmall dense models.\\n2.2. DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\\nReinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as ev-\\nidenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works\\nheavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we\\nexplore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data,\\nfocusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a\\nbrief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and\\nhope this provides the community with valuable insights.\\n2.2.1. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm\\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization\\nIn order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group\\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is\\ntypically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead.\\nSpecifically, for each question 𝑞, GRPO samples a group of outputs {𝑜1, 𝑜2, · · · , 𝑜𝐺} from the old\\npolicy 𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑and then optimizes the policy model 𝜋𝜃by maximizing the following objective:\\nJ𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑂(𝜃) = E[𝑞∼𝑃(𝑄), {𝑜𝑖}𝐺\\n𝑖=1 ∼𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑(𝑂|𝑞)]\\n1\\n𝐺\\n𝐺\\n∑︁\\n𝑖=1\\n\\x12\\nmin\\n\\x12 𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\\n𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑(𝑜𝑖|𝑞) 𝐴𝑖, clip\\n\\x12 𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\\n𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑(𝑜𝑖|𝑞) , 1 −𝜀, 1 + 𝜀\\n\\x13\\n𝐴𝑖\\n\\x13\\n−𝛽D𝐾𝐿\\n\\x00𝜋𝜃||𝜋𝑟𝑒𝑓\\n\\x01\\x13\\n,\\n(1)\\nD𝐾𝐿\\n\\x00𝜋𝜃||𝜋𝑟𝑒𝑓\\n\\x01 =\\n𝜋𝑟𝑒𝑓(𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\\n𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞) −log\\n𝜋𝑟𝑒𝑓(𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\\n𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞) −1,\\n(2)\\nwhere 𝜀and 𝛽are hyper-parameters, and 𝐴𝑖is the advantage, computed using a group of\\nrewards {𝑟1, 𝑟2, . . . , 𝑟𝐺} corresponding to the outputs within each group:\\n𝐴𝑖= 𝑟𝑖−m𝑒𝑎𝑛({𝑟1, 𝑟2, · · · , 𝑟𝐺})\\ns𝑡𝑑({𝑟1, 𝑟2, · · · , 𝑟𝐺})\\n.\\n(3)\\n5'),\n",

Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be\\nused to generate feedback based on predefined test cases.\\n• Format rewards: In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward\\nmodel that enforces the model to put its thinking process between ‘<think>’ and ‘</think>’\\ntags.\\nWe do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero,\\nbecause we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale\\nreinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training\\nresources and it complicates the whole training pipeline.\\n2.2.3. Training Template\\nTo train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we begin by designing a straightforward template that guides\\nthe base model to adhere to our specified instructions. As depicted in Table 1, this template\\nrequires DeepSeek-R1-Zero to first produce a reasoning process, followed by the final answer.\\nWe intentionally limit our constraints to this structural format, avoiding any content-specific\\nbiases—such as mandating reflective reasoning or promoting particular problem-solving strate-\\ngies—to ensure that we can accurately observe the model’s natural progression during the RL\\nprocess.\\n2.2.4.

For instance, DeepSeek-R1-Zero struggles with challenges like poor readability,\\nand language mixing. To make reasoning processes more readable and share them with the\\nopen community, we explore DeepSeek-R1, a method that utilizes RL with human-friendly\\ncold-start data.\\n2.3. DeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start\\nInspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can\\nreasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small\\namount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that\\nnot only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong\\ngeneral capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The\\npipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows.\\n2.3.1. Cold Start\\nUnlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from\\nthe base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data\\nto fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several\\napproaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting\\nmodels to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-\\nZero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human\\nannotators.\\nIn this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as\\nthe starting point for RL.

Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to\\nhighlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1,\\nwe design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and\\nfilters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as\\n|special_token|<reasoning_process>|special_token|<summary>, where the reasoning\\nprocess is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning\\nresults.\\n• Potential: By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we\\nobserve better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is\\na better way for reasoning models.\\n2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning\\nAfter fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale\\nreinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses\\non enhancing the model’s reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such\\nas coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with\\nclear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing,\\nparticularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language\\nmixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated\\nas the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show\\nthat such alignment results in a slight degradation in the model’s performance, this reward\\naligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of\\nreasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the\\nfinal reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence\\non reasoning tasks.\\n2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning\\nWhen reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT\\n(Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which\\nprimarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the\\nmodel’s capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we\\ngenerate the data and fine-tune the model as described below.\\nReasoning data\\nWe curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by perform-\\ning rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage,\\nwe only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage,\\nwe expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward\\nmodel by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment.\\nAdditionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have\\nfiltered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long parapraphs, and code blocks.

Reinforcement Learning for all Scenarios\\nTo further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement\\nlearning stage aimed at improving the model’s helpfulness and harmlessness while simultane-\\nously refining its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using a combination\\nof reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we adhere to the\\nmethodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the\\nlearning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to\\nreward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build\\nupon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and train-\\ning prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the\\nassessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing\\ninterference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire\\nresponse of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and\\nmitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation\\nprocess. Ultimately, the integration of reward signals and diverse data distributions enables us\\nto train a model that excels in reasoning while prioritizing helpfulness and harmlessness.\\n2.4.

This im-\\nprovement is primarily attributed to enhanced accuracy in STEM-related questions, where signif-\\nicant gains are achieved through large-scale reinforcement learning. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1\\nexcels on FRAMES, a long-context-dependent QA task, showcasing its strong document analysis\\ncapabilities. This highlights the potential of reasoning models in AI-driven search and data\\nanalysis tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3,\\ndemonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where\\nOpenAI-o1 surpasses GPT-4o on this benchmark. However, DeepSeek-R1 performs worse than\\nDeepSeek-V3 on the Chinese SimpleQA benchmark, primarily due to its tendency to refuse\\nanswering certain queries after safety RL. Without safety RL, DeepSeek-R1 could achieve an\\naccuracy of over 70%.\\nDeepSeek-R1 also delivers impressive results on IF-Eval, a benchmark designed to assess a\\nmodel’s ability to follow format instructions. These improvements can be linked to the inclusion\\nof instruction-following data during the final stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL\\ntraining. Furthermore, remarkable performance is observed on AlpacaEval2.0 and ArenaHard,\\nindicating DeepSeek-R1’s strengths in writing tasks and open-domain question answering. Its\\nsignificant outperformance of DeepSeek-V3 underscores the generalization benefits of large-scale\\nRL, which not only boosts reasoning capabilities but also improves performance across diverse\\ndomains. Moreover, the summary lengths generated by DeepSeek-R1 are concise, with an\\naverage of 689 tokens on ArenaHard and 2,218 characters on AlpacaEval 2.0. This indicates that\\n13'),\n",

Reinforcement Learning\\nIn Section 3.2, we can see that by distilling DeepSeek-R1, the small model can achieve impressive\\nresults. However, there is still one question left: can the model achieve comparable performance\\nthrough the large-scale RL training discussed in the paper without distillation?\\nTo answer this question, we conduct large-scale RL training on Qwen-32B-Base using math,\\ncode, and STEM data, training for over 10K steps, resulting in DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B.

However, DeepSeek-R1-\\nDistill-Qwen-32B, which is distilled from DeepSeek-R1, performs significantly better than\\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across all benchmarks.\\nTherefore, we can draw two conclusions: First, distilling more powerful models into smaller\\nones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL mentioned in\\nthis paper require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance\\nof distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, advancing\\nbeyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and larger-\\nscale reinforcement learning.\\n4.2. Unsuccessful Attempts\\nIn the early stages of developing DeepSeek-R1, we also encountered failures and setbacks along\\nthe way. We share our failure experiences here to provide insights, but this does not imply that\\nthese approaches are incapable of developing effective reasoning models.\\nProcess Reward Model (PRM)\\nPRM is a reasonable method to guide the model toward better\\napproaches for solving reasoning tasks (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al.,\\n2023). However, in practice, PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate suc-\\ncess. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second,\\ndetermining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated\\nannotation using models may not yield satisfactory results, while manual annotation is not con-\\nducive to scaling up. Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward\\nhacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources\\nand it complicates the whole training pipeline. In conclusion, while PRM demonstrates a good\\nability to rerank the top-N responses generated by the model or assist in guided search (Snell\\net al., 2024), its advantages are limited compared to the additional computational overhead it\\nintroduces during the large-scale reinforcement learning process in our experiments.\\nMonte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\\nInspired by AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2017b) and AlphaZero (Sil-\\nver et al., 2017a), we explored using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance test-time\\ncompute scalability. This approach involves breaking answers into smaller parts to allow the\\nmodel to explore the solution space systematically. To facilitate this, we prompt the model to\\ngenerate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For\\ntraining, we first use collected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value\\nmodel. Subsequently, we use the resulting question-answer pairs to train both the actor model\\nand the value model, iteratively refining the process.\\nHowever, this approach encounters several challenges when scaling up the training. First,\\nunlike chess, where the search space is relatively well-defined, token generation presents an\\n15'),\n",

To address this, we set a maximum extension limit for each\\nnode, but this can lead to the model getting stuck in local optima. Second, the value model\\ndirectly influences the quality of generation since it guides each step of the search process.\\nTraining a fine-grained value model is inherently difficult, which makes it challenging for the\\nmodel to iteratively improve. While AlphaGo’s core success relied on training a value model to\\nprogressively enhance its performance, this principle proves difficult to replicate in our setup\\ndue to the complexities of token generation.\\nIn conclusion, while MCTS can improve performance during inference when paired with a\\npre-trained value model, iteratively boosting model performance through self-search remains a\\nsignificant challenge.\\n5. Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work\\nIn this work, we share our journey in enhancing model reasoning abilities through reinforcement\\nlearning. DeepSeek-R1-Zero represents a pure RL approach without relying on cold-start\\ndata, achieving strong performance across various tasks. DeepSeek-R1 is more powerful,\\nleveraging cold-start data alongside iterative RL fine-tuning. Ultimately, DeepSeek-R1 achieves\\nperformance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on a range of tasks.\\nWe further explore distillation the reasoning capability to small dense models. We use\\nDeepSeek-R1 as the teacher model to generate 800K training samples, and fine-tune several small\\ndense models. The results are promising: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B outperforms GPT-4o\\nand Claude-3.5-Sonnet on math benchmarks with 28.9% on AIME and 83.9% on MATH. Other\\ndense models also achieve impressive results, significantly outperforming other instruction-\\ntuned models based on the same underlying checkpoints.\\nIn the future, we plan to invest in research across the following directions for DeepSeek-R1.\\n• General Capability: Currently, the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 fall short of DeepSeek-V3\\nin tasks such as function calling, multi-turn, complex role-playing, and JSON output.\\nMoving forward, we plan to explore how long CoT can be leveraged to enhance tasks in\\nthese fields.\\n• Language Mixing: DeepSeek-R1 is currently optimized for Chinese and English, which\\nmay result in language mixing issues when handling queries in other languages. For\\ninstance, DeepSeek-R1 might use English for reasoning and responses, even if the query is\\nin a language other than English or Chinese. We aim to address this limitation in future\\nupdates.\\n• Prompting Engineering: When evaluating DeepSeek-R1, we observe that it is sensitive\\nto prompts. Few-shot prompting consistently degrades its performance. Therefore, we\\nrecommend users directly describe the problem and specify the output format using a\\nzero-shot setting for optimal results.\\n• Software Engineering Tasks: Due to the long evaluation times, which impact the effi-\\nciency of the RL process, large-scale RL has not been applied extensively in software\\nengineering tasks. As a result, DeepSeek-R1 has not demonstrated a huge improvement\\nover DeepSeek-V3 on software engineering benchmarks. Future versions will address\\nthis by implementing rejection sampling on software engineering data or incorporating\\nasynchronous evaluations during the RL process to improve efficiency.\\n16'),\n",

However, in practice, PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate suc-\\ncess. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second,'),\n",

However, in practice, PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate suc-\\ncess. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second,\\ndetermining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated\\nannotation using models may not yield satisfactory results, while manual annotation is not con-\\nducive to scaling up. Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward\\nhacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources\\nand it complicates the whole training pipeline. In conclusion, while PRM demonstrates a good\\nability to rerank the top-N responses generated by the model or assist in guided search (Snell\\net al., 2024), its advantages are limited compared to the additional computational overhead it\\nintroduces during the large-scale reinforcement learning process in our experiments.\\nMonte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)'),\n",
